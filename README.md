# CRUD using Stored Procedure .NET Core Web API

This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a .NET Core Web API utilizing stored procedures for interacting with a database.

## Description

The CRUD using Stored Procedure .NET Core Web API project showcases the utilization of stored procedures for handling CRUD operations within a .NET Core Web API application. Key features include:

- **Database Interaction**: Using stored procedures to interact with the database.
- **Create**: Adding new records to the database.
- **Read**: Fetching and displaying existing data.
- **Update**: Modifying and updating existing records.
- **Delete**: Removing records from the database.

## Features

- **Stored Procedures**: Utilizing stored procedures for CRUD operations.
- **API Endpoints**: Implementing endpoints for CRUD functionalities.
- **Database Connectivity**: Connecting and managing data through a database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iAmitMohanty/crud-stored-procedure-dotnet-core-web-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
4. Ensure you have the necessary .NET Core SDK installed on your system.
5. Set up and configure the database connection strings and stored procedures as per the project's instructions.
6. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. Upon running the application, access the designated API endpoints via tools like Postman or any web client.
2. Test the CRUD functionalities by making requests to the respective endpoints (create, read, update, delete).
3. Verify the interactions with the database by inspecting the changes made through the API endpoints.

## Dependencies

- .NET Core SDK
- Database system (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL) compatible with stored procedures
